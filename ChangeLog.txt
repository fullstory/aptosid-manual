MAJOR CHANGES
New file added
tor-privoxy-xx-htm:: it still needs some work  as i get more input

VERSION:::sidux-manual-01.14.2007.06.11-2007

MAJOR CHANGES
Major css-js folder change to enable MS IE 7 users to read the manuals.
MS IE 6 is still problematic, although atm, IE7 is not working either as the coding to get it to work,
made konqueror scroll across the page, so now that needs to be fixed. Still, at least the framework is there.

Therefore every xxx-xx-xx.htm has changed, and the flag-index, whilst working , is not as i want it
The flag-index and css-js for flags will undergo some tweaking over the next few days..
The readability of the sidux manual on MS IE6 is on the agenda, with a low priority ( its sucks , too bad MS IE6 atm).
A big positive from this latest css-js update is that  now can support properly the meta-manual,
however I am not expecting  plain sailing , and expect that the css-js will undergo some further changes.


FILE CHANGES
Yes there are but not as many as you would like, grin
internet-connecting mini-myagi deleted, as no longer maintained, replaced with
firestarter and guarddog
sys-admin-apt deleted the screensaver example for apt-cache inserted sidux-manuls
hw-dev-hw-dri minor change to a code box, nothing to do
sys-admin-rsync minor changes to code boxes nothing to do

VERSION:::sidux-manual-01.12.2007.06.03-2007

NOTE THE DATE::: -01.12.2007.06.03

There was no release of version 01.11 , it was an internal release to  test no-hex for de and es

Rhubarb Time
Major News::
-de and -es no longer have to put up with hex,, I made a decision that it will all be clear text in line with
the fact that the content.css default is dejavu and all htm files are set to utf-8.
Any other lang that has hex will also be changed over

The menu has been readjusted, so that 'installing stuff' has its own sub menu
The main driver for this decision was, as  more sys-admin topics will come on stream over time, and the meta-installer chaps are gearing up for user documentation, an update was needed.

It also has the benefit  of allowing langs with needs to have 5 words to say 3 words the sub menu space without me getting cranky!!!
The menu2.js in the lib was altered tp have 30 sub- menus

File Changes::
deleted an incorrect entry in a codebox for hw-dev-hw-dri, all langs fixed
term-konsole . gave the references to  the listing of 687 linux commands and beginners bash its on sub head

All lang maintainers should review each file for outstanding trans and typos

OTHER NEWS::
Polish lang is 4 files from going 'live'
maslot, your commitment to excellence and to the Polish community is truly outstanding

VERSION:::
sidux-manual-0.1.05.05.2007

MAJOR CHANGES:::
Version numbering has changed again! to come into line with debian naming conventions for deb making without pain(dashes are gone)
Flags are gone, well sort of, they have been replaced with a single pic, which when clicked takes you to a flag-index (atm the flag index does not validate, I need to tweak the css)
This change means:
1) To add a lang to the site only one file needs to be changed and that is the flag index

2) To make a tar for the live-cd version, all that needs to be done is to drop the 2 lang folders  into the live-cd folder which has a 2 lang  flag-index already prepared.

3) To enable  debs to be built that contain 1 lang through to the current available (8),  with minimum of fuss, so they can be part of the sidux apt-get repo, and enable users to have a local lang(s) version that gets updated via a  d-u.

4) This will help enable a proper manuals svn to happen and enable specialised versions of the manuals to be built with ease.

FILE CHANGES:::
internet-connecting	added how to stop miyagi and corrected a codebox

hd-install-opts		fromiso 2 extra lines added, more text will change shortly,  as the live-cd infrastructure is being totally rewritten

sys-admin-rdiff		mainly command line code example bug hunting, cobra has been a terrier squashing and fixing the examples in the codeboxes

misc files		other files had codebox errors fixed.

Trevor

sys-admin-xx has been depreciated and replaced by sys-admin-gen-xx
The monitor topic that was in sys-admin has been moved to hw-dev-hw-dri-xx
All menus updated to reflect the change

FILE CHANGES:::
Mostly rats and mice changes::
sys-admin-gen 	topics are services, lost pwds, fonts. monitors moved to hw-dev-hw-dri
hw-install opts	added ext2/3 to second para, fromiso from a vfat partition is not viable
hw-dev-hw-dri	Monitors are now here, Latino rewrote the ATI section

soon -ru will go live 21/35 done and only need 7 more, mind you the latest files
 that came in all used 'snap 39' not the tar I uploaded a few days ago,,
(RoEn, spank spank) This will mean a major menu upgrade for all langs to include
 the -ru flag

ssh - expect minor alts to the fish/konq topic, it seems that ooo/amarok/kedit dont
 like the fish protocol
ssh - going to expand the SSH topic by adding remote d-u cmd examples
sys-admin-apt expect a minor addition to include 'alias'
hw-dev-hw-dri, expect a minor addition of a code box so users dont have to
reboot when updating a module, (along the lines of modprobe -r * and modprobe * thing)

The next Live-cd release, 2007-02 Tartaros, will have new text on the Welcome-xx
I am preparing the files now for translation to go to 'live site' on the release of the
live-cd


Thats it for now

Version:
sidux-manaul-0.0-08-04-2007
sidux-manaul-0.0-08-04-2007 is for the langs that are 'live' on the main site
Yes , the version numbering has changed
This is to enable the manual to be made a 'deb' for users to DL and as
changes happen the user will automatically get an update when they do a d-u.

This also meant that the licence details on the Welcome file had to include a
'no Invariant Sections' clause to satisfy the Debian DSFG code of practice
particularly for the Live-cd.

I will make up a new lang pack for the lit team to include files that have transated
and the new -de/-en files and email you when ready

MAJOR CHANGES::::
Versioning numbering modified

Version:
sid-man-snap-40-master and sid-man-snap-40-lit

snap-40-master... is for the langs that are 'live' on the main site
snap-40-lit... is for 'languages in translation (el,it,pl.ru)

MAJOR CHANGES::::
A print.css is now operating, this will give users a black type
print out (not colour, I assumed that if a printer was set to
grey scale, coloured type would not print very well).

The print.css will also print a url,,previously, if you printed
a page all that would print was the text linking to the url.

The print.css necessitated all files (385 of them) in all langs (11)
having an extra line in the head and a special tag inserted
in the very first <h2> after the menu.

Thanks must go to h2 of !h2-du-fixes for providing the top half
of the print.css and what had to be included on each .htm.

FILE CHANGES::: (don't all groan at once, grin)
4 new files were added in early March  the sidux-lamp-stack (3 files)
and meta-packages (1 file)

cd-contents	Meta-packages heading- text deleted and a new file added
		called sys-admin-meta. please check that the link meta
		is in your lang

cheatcodes - 	a deletion of the lang cheat,, this has already been done
		in all langs

hd-install - 	all langs need to cut the mention of langs in the second
		last para of Install -Preparation, and amend as per the -en

sys-admin	Services heading , para revision to first para needed as per -en

hw-dev-hw-dri-	Experimental has been axed  please check your lang

lamp-apache	sidux-lamp-stack heading last line before FTP Clients head
		needs a trans, as a para was deleted and a code box change

Internet-connecting	Desktop-PCs with 2 NIC's (Internet sharing) heading
			Deletion of reference to unfreeze/freeze in
			update-rc.d -f dnsmasq defaults code box



UPCOMING CHANGES

sys-admin	Latino is putting together info for Dual Monitors, he has ATI
		figured out, and posted it on the forum to look for feedback
		and nvidia info.Therefore this file will be updated in the next
		few days, expect an email!

		Further to Dual monitors, some info on DPI and fonts is on the boil
		for the same page - TBA

hw-dev-hw-dri	Non-Free heading,, the para that mentions the kernels will
		be changed - TBA

help		elinks is the pre installed app, however user guide material
		to use it is as scarce as hens teeth, if any of you have a basic
		knowledge to operate elinks, like the w3m, please write it and
		email to me.

TODO
We are in need pics in your lang for netcardconfig, gparted, cfdisk, atm most
of these pics are in -en , please check and then supply if you can. It is not
critical,, just be good to have native lang pics (ksnapshot is fine)

The installer pic6 are incorrect for all langs except -ro, it mentions ~knofig,
instead of siduxconf.
,
That's it for now, (and enough!)

Changelog for sidux-manual-2007
Mon 05/03/2007 ADEST 1900hrs and Mon 05/03/2007 UTC 0800hrs
Version:
sid-man-snap-37-master-WIP
Major Changes::::
All files now include 	''<link rel ="shortcut icon"
href="../lib/favicon/manual.ico" />'' to enable the manual icon
to appear in a browser address bar.
As it fell outside the scope of the menu-updater
it was a paste or perl job to 217 files, So i took
the opportunity to review code, a few files had
.exe perms,, so they were changed, a few others had
multiple lines coded as one line,, they were altered
back to policy. ..other than that WOW, great going

File Changes::
Only change made to EN was line 273 of rdiff to add 5) ip address
where it was 4) swap and IP address
thanks dedo.. most other langs have that change,, except for -es,,
(Richard, its line 253 in -es)
Also the -es version menu was fixed to include rsync again
thanks to dedo for noticing it!


In general this is how it pans out:
Added a sticky to sidux-request forum for users to post
typos/errors/mistakes

Everything has settled down considerably regarding
alterations/edits (at last!).
-dk has has 4 updated files added, and  is coping with a new baby
and lucky to get any sleep, zonker , take it easy,,
you and your family are the most important
-ro is fully up,
-nl, still some outstanding files to be translated,
-hr only 4 files to come.... go cobra! (update make that 3 files)
ssh-hr added after tar was made to current site/main site)
-it has 13 files to go to be able to go live,
dedo is bearing the brunt of -it version.

There have been some starts made on a couple of other languages,
however not gone anywhere, yet,

It takes very special people to decide, 'I am going to do this" and then do it.

Once again, thank you to all for your imput into sidux,
sidux-manuals is very lucky to have you all aboard.

Just in case any of you were wondering how many on the sidux-manual team
I have uploaded an active team list

NB: over the next few weeks it would be great if all
trans teams can look at the EN version (and each others
translations if able to) as per current-version on bluewater
site looking for faults then alerting the faults,
and updating your langs to come into line.

The main reason for this is to ensure total
cohesion accross all translations and to get ready for
the next release due in May 2007.

Version = sidix-manuals-proof-31-master-WIP
As there are some fast moving changes, usually to to with installation
I decided to go for a snapshot
Changed files are:
hd-install (having a sep data partition, and knofig , is now siduxconf this change already done on all lang files on main site and in currebt-version on our ftp)
hd-install-opts (USB Install)
hw-dev-hw-dri  (changed 03-02-2007)

Version = sidix-manuals-proof-30-master

Use only this version as the menu has been changed over to account for a new file.
New file for all langs:
part-uuid

As time goes on this will replace the Disk Naming in part-cfdisk, if it already has not!
This change has therefore, in the short term,has  meant Warnings on part-cfdisk and part-gparted
for the short term. All langs please check those two files and translate accordingly.

ES :: hd-istall-opts  a change to usb-hd subtopic . atm its in EN and needs trans to ES

All langs::  please look at welcome-en and adjust welcome text and "how to use this manual',
accordingly or your lang

cd-content:::: be prepared for a sudden need of trans, this page is so far out of date its not funny!
Also be prepared for hw-dev-hw-dri to change , some major goings on with 3D graphics drivers.

As an aside:: current-version folder.. hhhmmmm  i will take off the index.html
so that it does not auto-start to a lang, and please bear in mind the following:
current version maybe behind whats on the main site, due to the necessity to move fast
to provide our users the latest possible guidance. having said that, current version should
reflect the latest changes (its a caveat thing, grin)

Sat 16Dec 2006 1400 AEDST UTC  Sat 16 Dec 0300hrs by bluewater:

The FTP was playing up last night so proof-2 did did not get uploaded except the tar
so i am taking down the tar and uploading a revised proof-2.

Most changes are with the menu sub-topics.

'Whats on this CD' has been reworked, however we are waiting on further
 specifications so the page has been left incomplete.
This page needs 'the-whats-going-to-be-in-sudix-team' to let us in on whats what.

I have also added VM Ware to install-options, however dont expect
the page to validate, as the sub-topic on vmware needs totally restructuring.

I have added SSH to the samba page, again some stuff missing

The hw-dev-hw-dri.htm regarding graphics driver, has had all the information cut from it
and we are now waiting for documentation for grahpics drivers.
This page also needs 'the-whats-going-to-be-in-sudix-team' to let us in on whats what.
__________________________________________________________
Fri 15 Dec 2006 0130 AEDST UTC  Fri 16 Dec 1430hrs by bluewater

Proof-2 is up. so whats the difference  well only the welcome page
shows correct menu names
Major change to  cd-content topic,, needs kernel and "whats-in-Dev-team"
to look at this as its critical going forward..

In Graphics topic all content relegated to TBA this is totally unacceptable
It should mention native drivers if nothing else.

Wed 13 Dec 2006 0055 AEDST UTC  Tues 12 Dec 1355hrs by bluewater

I have a slightly tweaked new menu.css The menu.css is time/date stamped
as:""Last updated by bluewater 12/12/2007 1614hrs ADEST :: 12/12/2007 0514hrs UTC""
It should  stop any <li> coded text turning black on mouseover
Just DL it and place it in your lib/css-js folder and allow overwrite

I have also updated it in the static-4 folder and in incoming folder,
static-4 tar has not altered and contains old menu.css

Uploaded sidux-manual-static-04 last night
to test before logging it in

On my 800x600 HP screen which is also a small screen,
firefox2 is still flickering on some menus and not others ggrr
In konq. the menu is dropping off the bottoam of my screen but
does not flicker.. grrr again

Menus: Menus now contain all the subheads i wanted and appear to be working
correctly, except for Sys-Admin ,I cant find why 'Overwritten boot MBR'
will not reload when I choose another subhead and go back to it.
I even wiped out everything above MBR and copied in another top portion.
more gggrrrr

Content EN: Good news, Content is now coded up now gearing up for proofing
and working out how to manage it.

Content DE:Still embryonic stage, lots to be done (like 99% of it)

4 lines are to be fixed in the content.css due to any coding containing a <li>
sends the area concerned to black. The lines effected are 47,51,76,80
(I just havent done it yet)

Coding up each page for an additional page is a right pain in the
you know where, I need someone to write a small script to do it automatically

Uploaded sidux-manual-static-03
This has broken the back of the major coding,,
there may be 1 or perhaps 3 pages left,

Some of the pages will need a major make-over
regarding content e.g. graphics drivers in sidux
Now on to the proofing of the content for EN version

Known bugs:
menu.css is still not quite there:
The flicker in ff is a known ff-gecko-engine bug for css
(not going to fix ff at this point,, maybe 2 years time heh)

Some menu errors are caused by me, with an incorrect
copy and paste from the master menu i built...as I hand
copied to some 30 pages and muffed it .... (mea culpa)

static-4 or 5 should fix all known menu bugs

I have noticed my Changelog has gone MIA,, so this is an abridged reconstruction
Whats happened:
Created a LIB folder for the css blah blah, this will enable
both DE and EN to use commom CSS and help minimise errors
iamges folder has had a similar treatment
been concentrating on naming conventions of .htm files,, and these
naming conventions are applicable for both de and EN versions
very soon proof readers that have out there hands up o proof read
the EN version will be required get involved

5/12/2006 AEDST 1800hrs - 5/12/2006 UTC 0700hrs


NOTE: This is a pilot only
menu.css has been enhanced
content.css has been enhanced

Regarding the css highlights are:
Warning is red
Tips is violet
Watchout is orange
The other colour is teal and i have forgotten whats its for (lol)

A body of content.htm has been added and is the guide to how
things are to be coded up

No hard coding will be permitted!!!!!
If you want to change something we will do it in the CSS!!
(if I have hardcoded anything let me know,
as i have been staring at this for the last 48 hrs!)

images
images in their respective subfolders,
subfolders have en and de tags
this will make it easy to add new images without
hunting through 100s of pics

CLICK THE INDEX.HTM
NOTE: This is a pilot only
The coding is not consistent YET but will be
menu is normal font now not so chunky
links working for sub menu headings
The back to main menu is a dummy link
The green in the menu will be changed once official art is decided on

Things i need feedback on are:
Font sizing
Colours for warnings
So far Warnings are red
Watch-out is a green ,, another colour preferable
Some are still blue which should only be used for url linking
Proposals for other colours so far are:
Watch-out to be orange
tips/recommendations to be violet
